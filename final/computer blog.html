                <h1>Early Computing Devices.</h1>
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <p>1.Abacus</p>

            <p>-Abacus was invented by the Chinese around 4000 years ago. It&rsquo;s a wooden rack with metal rods with
                beads attached to them. The abacus operator moves the beads according to certain guidelines to complete
                arithmetic computations.</p>

            <p> 2.Napier&rsquo;s Bone</p>

            <p>-John Napier devised Napier&rsquo;s Bones, a manually operated calculating apparatus. For calculating,
                this instrument used 9 separate ivory strips (bones) marked with numerals to multiply and divide. It was
                also the first machine to calculate using the decimal point system.</p>

            <p> 3.Pascaline</p>

            <p>-Pascaline was invented in 1642 by Biaise Pascal, a French mathematician and philosopher. It is thought
                to
                be the first mechanical and automated calculator. It was a wooden box with gears and wheels inside.</p>

            <p> 4.Stepped Reckoner or Leibniz wheel</p>

            <p>-In 1673, a German mathematician-philosopher named Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved on Pascal&rsquo;s
                invention to create this apparatus. It was a digital mechanical calculator known as the stepped reckoner
                because it used fluted drums instead of gears.</p>

            <p> 5.Difference Engine</p>

            <p>-In the early 1820s, Charles Babbage created the Difference Engine. It was a mechanical computer that
                could do basic computations. It was a steam-powered calculating machine used to solve numerical tables
                such as logarithmic tables.</p>

            <p> 6.Analytical Engine</p>

            <p>-Charles Babbage created another calculating machine, the Analytical Engine, in 1830. It was a mechanical
                computer that took input from punch cards. It was capable of solving any mathematical problem and
                storing data in an indefinite memory.</p>

            <p> 7.Tabulating machine</p>

            <p>-An American Statistician &ndash; Herman Hollerith invented this machine in the year 1890. Tabulating
                Machine was a punch card-based mechanical tabulator. It could compute statistics and record or sort data
                or information. Hollerith began manufacturing these machines in his company, which ultimately became
                International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924.</p>

            <p> 8.Differential Analyzer</p>

            <p>-Vannevar Bush introduced the first electrical computer, the Differential Analyzer, in 1930. This machine
                is made up of vacuum tubes that switch electrical impulses in order to do calculations. It was capable
                of performing 25 calculations in a matter of minutes.</p>

            <p> 9.Mark I</p>

            <p>-Howard Aiken planned to build a machine in 1937 that could conduct massive calculations or calculations
                using enormous numbers. The Mark I computer was constructed in 1944 as a collaboration between IBM and
                Harvard.</p>
        </ul>

        <p>The history of computing goes way back before we even had actual computer hardware. It also involves all the
            ways people used to do math with just pen and paper, or chalk and slate, sometimes with the help of
            tables. Numbers have always been a big part of computing, even though the math needed for computing was
            around before we had our numeral systems..</p>

        <h2 id="licenses" class="collapsible">Charles Babbage</h2>
        <div>

            <p>Since the dawn of humanity, tools have been utilized for calculations over many centuries. Among the
                earliest and most renowned devices was the abacus. In 1822, Charles Babbage, considered the pioneer of
                computing, embarked on the development of the first mechanical computer. By 1833, he had conceived the
                Analytical Engine, a versatile computer featuring an Arithmetic Logic Unit, fundamental flowchart
                principles, and the notion of integrated memory. Over a century later, the ENIAC, or Electronic
                Numerical Integrator and Computer, marked the advent of the first general-purpose electronic computer.

        <h2 id="v2.43.0" nr="6" class="collapsible"> Generations of Computers
        </h2></small>
        <div>

            <p>
            <h3>1st Generation(1940-1955).</h3>
            </p>

            <p>This was when machine language was developed for the use of computers. They used vacuum tubes for the
                circuitry. For the purpose of memory, they used magnetic drums. These machines were complicated, large,
                and expensive. They were mostly reliant on batch operating systems and punch cards. As output and input
                devices, magnetic tape and paper tape were implemented. For example, ENIAC, UNIVAC-1, EDVAC, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3>2nd Generation(1957-1963).</h3>
            </p>

            <p>In second-generation computers, COBOL and FORTRAN are employed as assembly languages and programming
                languages. Here they advanced from vacuum tubes to transistors. This made the computers smaller, faster
                and more energy-efficient. And they advanced from binary to assembly languages. For instance, IBM 1620,
                IBM 7094, CDC 1604, CDC 3600, and so forth.</p>

            <p>
            <h3>3rd Generation(1964-1971).</h3>
            </p>

            <p>The hallmark of this period was the development of the integrated circuit. A single integrated circuit
                (IC) is made up of many transistors, which increases the power of a computer while simultaneously
                lowering its cost. These computers were quicker, smaller, more reliable, and less expensive than their
                predecessors. High-level programming languages such as FORTRON-II to IV, COBOL, and PASCAL PL/1 were
                utilized. For example, the IBM-360 series, the Honeywell-6000 series, and the IBM-370/168.</p>

            <p>
            <h3>4th Generation(1971-1980).</h3>
            </p>

            <p> The invention of the microprocessors brought along the fourth generation of computers. C, C++ and Java
                were the programming languages utilized in this generation of computers. For instance, the STAR 1000,
                PDP 11, CRAY-1, CRAY-X-MP, and Apple II. This was when we started producing computers for home use.</p>

            <p>
            <h3>5th Generation(1980-now).</h3>
            </p>

            <p> This is the present and the future of the computer world. The defining aspect of this generation is
                artificial intelligence. The use of parallel processing and superconductors are making this a reality
                and provide a lot of scope for the future. Fifth-generation computers use ULSI (Ultra Large Scale
                Integration) technology. These are the most recent and sophisticated computers. C, C++, Java,.Net, and
                more programming languages are used. For instance, IBM, Pentium, Desktop, Laptop, Notebook, Ultrabook,
                and so on.</p>

            <h3>1. Analog Computers</h3>
            </p>

            <p> &ndash; Analog computers are built with various components such as gears and levers, with no electrical
                components. One advantage of analogue computation is that designing and building an analogue computer to
                tackle a specific problem can be quite straightforward.</p>

            <p> &ndash; Information in digital computers is represented in discrete form, typically as sequences of 0s
                and 1s (binary digits, or bits). A digital computer is a system or gadget that can process any type of
                information in a matter of seconds. Digital computers are categorized into many different types. They
                are as follows:</p>

            <p>
            <h3> a. Mainframe computers</h3>
            </p>


            <p> &ndash; It is a computer that is generally utilized by large enterprises for mission-critical activities
                such as massive data processing. Mainframe computers were distinguished by massive storage capacities,
                quick components, and powerful computational capabilities. Because they were complicated systems, they
                were managed by a team of systems programmers who had sole access to the computer. These machines are
                now referred to as servers rather than mainframes.</p>

            <p>
            <h3> b. Supercomputers</h3>
            </p>

            <p> &ndash; The most powerful computers to date are commonly referred to as supercomputers. Supercomputers
                are enormous systems that are purpose-built to solve complicated scientific and industrial problems.
                Quantum mechanics, weather forecasting, oil and gas exploration, molecular modelling, physical
                simulations, aerodynamics, nuclear fusion research, and cryptoanalysis are all done on supercomputers.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3> c. Minicomputers</h3>
            </p>

            <p> &ndash; A minicomputer is a type of computer that has many of the same features and capabilities as a
                larger computer but is smaller in size. Minicomputers, which were relatively small and affordable, were
                often employed in a single department of an organization and were often dedicated to a specific task or
                shared by a small group. Microcomputers &ndash; A microcomputer is a small computer that is based on a
                microprocessor integrated circuit, often known as a chip. A microcomputer is a system that incorporates
                at a minimum a microprocessor, program memory, data memory, and input-output system (I/O). A
                microcomputer is now commonly referred to as a personal computer (PC).</p>

            <p>
            <h3> d. Embedded processors</h3>
            </p>

            <p> &ndash; These are miniature computers that control electrical and mechanical processes with basic
                microprocessors. Embedded processors are often simple in design, have limited processing capability and
                I/O capabilities, and need little power. Ordinary microprocessors and microcontrollers are the two
                primary types of embedded processors. Embedded processors are employed in systems that do not require
                the computing capability of traditional devices such as desktop computers, laptop computers, or
                workstations.</p>

        <div>

            <p>1. Charles Babbage</p>
            <p> Known for being the first to come up with an automatic calculator, Charles Babbage was
                a mathematician in Victorian England. He created plans to build the Analytical Engine, a machine that
                contained some aspects of modern computers.1 Though it was never built in his lifetime, the concepts and
                plans Babbage purposed have earned him the title of the &quot;father of computing.&quot;1</p>

            <p>2. Ada Lovelace Babbage</p>
            <p> was not the only person in Victorian England considering the possibility of
                computers. Ada Lovelace is known as the first programmer in history. She was the daughter of poet Lord
                Byron and a good friend of Babbage. Having found interest in his ideas, Ada took to writing algorithms
                to be used on a machine. While these programs were not used in her lifetime, she laid the foundations
                for all modern programmers.</p>

            <p>3. Alan Turing</p>

            <p>During World War II, the Germans had invented the enigma machine to encrypt messages. Alan Turing led a
                team to cracking many of these messages and, in turn, saved many lives. He is now considered
                contributing to the modern computer with his contributions to the field.</p>

            <p>he is also remembered for his theories on artificial intelligence that are still studied today. The
                Turing test is his most prominent idea, as it looks at whether a computer can mimic human behavior
                independently and fool people, work in robotics and artificial intelligence is built on these ideas.</p>

            <p>4. Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>Whenever you search for websites you can thank Tim Berners-Lee for his contributions to the field. He
                invented the World Wide Web, a system of pulling up web pages for websites.5 Whenever you type in
                &ldquo;www.&rdquo; you are searching for a site on the World Wide Web. While many advancements have come
                about since then, Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s contributions are still the building blocks of the internet.
            </p>

            <p>5. Steve Wozniak</p>

            <p>Everyone is aware of Steve Jobs and how Apple is one of the biggest names in the computer and smartphone
                markets. However, many are unaware of Steve Wozniak and his contributions. Computers were originally
                very large and too expensive for regular Americans to own. Companies like Windows and Apple changed this
                trend. Wozniak cofounded Apple Computer Company alongside Steve Jobs in 1976. They released the Apple II
                which was one of the first highly successful personal computers in 1977.6</p>

            <p>6.Linus Torvalds</p>

            <p>Linus Torvalds is best known for creating the Linux Operating System.7 He made the kernel of the
                operating system which is the brain that helps the system running correctly. All parts of the system
                need a kernel to work correctly. People can use the kernel for free and build all the features they need
                for a system.7 This operating system is a good alternative to Windows and Mac IOS since it gives a
                people the ability to modify the system even at the base level.</p>

            <p>7. Guido van Rossum </p>
            <p> programming languages have come and gone over the years. Each program can be
                beneficial in certain situations, but some languages have widespread usage. When Guido van Rossum made
                the Python programming language, he made it for a general purpose in mind.8</p>

            <p>Today, Python is one of the most widely used and recognized languages on the market.8 Programming is a
                sought after skill that can lead you into software development among other fields.</p>

            <p>A peripheral device is an additional piece of hardware that a computer uses to communicate information
                externally. It is a hardware component that can be accessed and controlled by a computer, but is not
                considered a core part of the computer.</p>

            <p>Peripherals can be classified based on how information flows in relation to the computer:</p>

            <p> 1.Input devices: such as mouse, keyboards, scanners, game controllers, microphones, and webcams, send
                data to the computer.</p>

            <p>Networking </p>

            <p>&bull; A computer network or data network is a telecommunications network that allows computers
                to exchange data. Networked computing devices pass data to each other in the form of packets
                across connections established using either cable or wireless media.</p>

            <p>&bull; A network packet is a formatted unit of data sent through a network to the destination.
                Once packets arrive, they are reassembled into their original message.</p>

            <p>&bull; Wired media includes coaxial cable, twisted-pair cable, and optical fiber.</p>

            <p>&bull; Wireless local area network connections use spread spectrum technology based on a common
                flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology defined as IEEE 802.11 and known as
                Wi-Fi.</p>

            <p>&bull; A network interface controller (NIC) is hardware that provides a computer with the ability
                to access the transmission media, and has the ability to process low-level network information.
            </p>

            <p>Device Addresses</p>

            <p>&bull; In Ethernet networks, each NIC has a unique 48-bit Media Access Control (MAC) address.</p>

            <p>&bull; An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device
                participating in a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address
                serves two principal functions: host identification and network addressing.</p>

            <p> &bull; IP addresses are 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6) numbers usually written and displayed in
                human-readable notations, such as 198.51.100.1 (IPv4), and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 (IPv6).</p>

            <p>&bull; IP addresses are assigned to a host either anew at the time of booting, or permanently by
                fixed configuration of its hardware or software. Persistent configuration is also known as using
                a static IP address. In contrast, in situations when the computer's IP address is assigned newly
                each time, this is known as using a dynamic IP address.</p>

            <p> &bull; Static IP addresses are manually assigned to a computer by an administrator.</p>

            <p>&bull; Dynamic IP addresses are assigned either by the computer interface or host software itself
                through automatic configuration, or assigned by a server using Dynamic Host Configuration
                Protocol (DHCP).[12]</p>

            <p>Device Types</p>

            <p>&bull; A switch is a device that connects and filters multiple network segments or devices, by
                forwarding data only to one or multiple devices that need to receive the data based on
                destination MAC address.</p>

            <p>&bull; A router is a device that forwards data packets between different computer networks based
                on network address (IP address).</p>

            <p> &bull; A modem is a device used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for
                digital network traffic, by modulating the digital signal to produce an analog signal for
                transmission. &bull; A firewall is a device used to control network security and access rules by
                rejecting access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones.
            </p>

            <p> &bull; An access point is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network
                using Wi-Fi, or related standards.</p>

                monitoring and data manipulation functions</p>

            <p>-Operating systems are &quot;the layer of software that manages a computer's resources for its users and
                their applications&quot;</p>

            <p>-Application software runs on top of the operating system and uses the computer's resources to perform a
                task. Applications account for most software and require the environment provided by an operating
                system, and often other applications, in order to function.</p>
